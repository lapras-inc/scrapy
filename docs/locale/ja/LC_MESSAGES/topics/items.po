"The main goal in scraping is to extract structured data from unstructured"
" sources, typically, web pages. Scrapy spiders can return the extracted "
"data as Python dicts. While convenient and familiar, Python dicts lack "
"structure: it is easy to make a typo in a field name or return "
"inconsistent data, especially in a larger project with many spiders."

"To define common output data format Scrapy provides the :class:`Item` "
"class. :class:`Item` objects are simple containers used to collect the "
"scraped data. They provide a `dictionary-like`_ API with a convenient "
"syntax for declaring their available fields."

"Various Scrapy components use extra information provided by Items: "
"exporters look at declared fields to figure out columns to export, "
"serialization can be customized using Item fields metadata, "
":mod:`trackref` tracks Item instances to help find memory leaks (see :ref"
":`topics-leaks-trackrefs`), etc."

"Those familiar with `Django`_ will notice that Scrapy Items are declared "

":class:`Field` objects are used to specify metadata for each field. For "

"You can specify any kind of metadata for each field. There is no "
"restriction on the values accepted by :class:`Field` objects. For this "
"same reason, there is no reference list of all available metadata keys. "
"Each key defined in :class:`Field` objects could be used by a different "
"component, and only those components know about it. You can also define "
"and use any other :class:`Field` key in your project too, for your own "
"needs. The main goal of :class:`Field` objects is to provide a way to "
"define all field metadata in one place. Typically, those components whose"
" behaviour depends on each field use certain field keys to configure that"
" behaviour. You must refer to their documentation to see which metadata "
"keys are used by each component."
