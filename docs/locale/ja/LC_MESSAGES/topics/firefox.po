"Since Firefox add-ons operate on a live browser DOM, what you'll actually"
" see when inspecting the page source is not the original HTML, but a "
"modified one after applying some browser clean up and executing "
"Javascript code.  Firefox, in particular, is known for adding ``<tbody>``"
" elements to tables.  Scrapy, on the other hand, does not modify the "
"original page HTML, so you won't be able to extract any data if you use "
"``<tbody>`` in your XPath expressions."
